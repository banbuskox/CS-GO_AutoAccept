# CS-GO_AutoAccept
It's basically Auto Accept for CS GO that I made. It's automatically pressing the ACCEPT button when it shows up.

Instructions :
1. Download
2. Open Requirements.bat
3. Open main.py to start Auto Accept

Requirements :
1. Python 3.9.9 (or newer) (didn't tested on 3.10)
2. pyautogui Library

If you are using other language than English you need to make remake of button screenshots (highlighted button and not highlighted button) (accept_image2.png, accept_image.png)

If you are Polish I have screenshots from my Polish friend (They are in .zip) :
